# Installing Fedora 19 and freedreno on ifc6410

Instructions for install Fedora 19 on the [ifc6410](http://inforcecomputing.com/blog/?p=27) pico-itx board.

Note that these instructions are work-in-progress.

1. Download Fedora 19 [filesystem](https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora-secondary/releases/test/19-Beta/Images/armhfp/Fedora-armhfp-19-Beta-1-sda.raw.xz), see https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM/F19/Beta
2. If you haven't already, install adb, fastboot, abootimg.  If your host is fedora, you can `sudo yum install android-tools`
2. While you are waiting, boot android which came on the ifc6410 board, and save off the firmware:
 * connect to device: `adb shell`
 * on device, `cd /system/etc; tar czvf /data/firmware.tgz firmware`
 * back on host: `adb pull /data/firmware.tgz`
3. on your host, xzcat Fedora-armhfp-19-Beta-1-sda.raw.xz > /dev/sdN  (ie, /dev/sdb)
4. mount /dev/sdN3, and fix things up:
 * edit <mountpath>/etc/fstab for correct device paths (or UUID) for root, boot, and swap (which will be /dev/sda3, /dev/sda1, and /dev/sda2 respectively)
 * extract firmware saved from device, `cd <mountpath>/lib; tar xzvf path/to/firmware.tgz`
5.
